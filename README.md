# Tableau_Dashboards
Tableau Dashboard Portfolio

In this repository are a variety of Tableau dashboards designed in Tableau Public to demonstrate my data visualization skills.

To view them locally, download the workbook (.twb) and store it in the Workbooks folder in Tableau's Repository (My Tableau Repository in Tableau Public),
then download the corresponding data source and store it in the Datasources folder.
